# Experiance.

Got some *killer app*, some *neat project*, a cool portfolio? Make an easy single-page site to show it all off. SinglePaged uses jekyll niceties to make a ***polished, modular, and beautiful* single page site**.

Oh-- go see [some examples](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged#fancy-jekyll-powered-single-page-site)!

- Developing a deep understanding of how clients operate and how technology can be leveraged to create new value streams. 
- Each vertical section sets it's own **color**, **header icon** (or image), **title**, and easy-to-write markdown body.
- Only **two things** to edit:
  1. Edit `_config.yml` to set the site title, description, etc
  2. Add `_posts/*.md` to make each vertical section. Copy some examples and add the sections from your README.md for a fast start!
- Easy adding of **SEO terms**, **favicon** & such, and **google analytics token**.

Sound good? Let's go!

There are three way to get started: (links jump to that section)

1. Make a [**user homepage**](#setup-as-user-homepage) (or organization)
2. Make a [**standalone project**](#setup-as-standalone-project-page) page
3. Make a [site under an **existing project**](#setup-inside-existing-project)
